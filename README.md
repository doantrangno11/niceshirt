I was wondering if he just looks bigger cause she’s a little person and I try to be good but I take after my husband shirt and he’s holding the smaller looking. Her type of dwarfism doesn’t generally show until the baby is around 2 I think. Or something like that. Later on anyway. So unless they do some genetic testing, they won’t know just yet. I read they’re both average sizes but 1 is bigger which is usual for twins? Not sure if its true!
